== `README` template

This file provides a template basis for Maven projects. Using only some variables, it adds badges for:

* https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI];
* https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls];
* https://scan.coverity.com/[Coverity Scan];
* a license badge.

Here are the variables you should set to benefit it.

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Variable         | Signification
| `github-user`    | The name of the Github repository owner
| `github-repo`    | The name of the Github repository
| `coverity-name`  | The identifier of the project on Coverity Scan
| `coverity-scan`  | The identifier of the Coverity Scan badge
| `license-name`   | The license name, used as an alternative text for the badge
| `license-shield` | The license name, displayed on the badge (`_` for space and `--` for `-`)
| `license-url`    | The URL to a detailed version of the license
|===

You must still write the documentation, though. ;)

== `.gitignore` template

This is a template with versions for several projects options (essentially Maven for now).

It also takes IDEs (Eclipse and Cloud9) into account.
