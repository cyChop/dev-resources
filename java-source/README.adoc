== `CyclicDependenciesTest`

This class ensures there are no cyclic dependencies in packages of a Maven-built project. This is still a bit lenient as it does not control cyclic dependencies within classes, but it's a start for a clean and well-thought structure.

This is to be inserted in the main package of each module of a Maven project, in the `src/test/java` directory.

Required Maven dependencies::
* `junit:junit`
* `jdepend:jdepend`
